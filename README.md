# Personal_website
This is a personal website for myself where I created for a class final project.
Its a professional personal website where it describes my experiences that I went through for my career in computer science.
The website consist of an about me, previous work experiences, projects that I have worked on, and a contact form for those who want to come in contact with me.
The website is ran through visual studio code where it use an extension call "live server" as it runs the html file with a local ip for viewing of the website.
However, there is a github webpage deployed which uses the files in this repository.
